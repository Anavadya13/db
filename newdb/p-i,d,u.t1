Based on the image you provided, here is a solution outline for the SQL tasks.

### Table Creation

sql
CREATE TABLE ADMIS (
    BRANCH VARCHAR(50),
    SID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SNAME VARCHAR(50),
    MATHS INT,
    PHY INT,
    CHEM INT,
    TOT INT
);

CREATE TABLE SEATPOSITION (
    DNAME VARCHAR(50),
    TOTALSEATS INT,
    ADMITTED INT DEFAULT 0,
    VACANCY INT
);


### Part (a): Stored Procedure for Insert, Delete, and Update Operations

This procedure can handle insert, delete, and update operations on the ADMIS table.

sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE ManageAdmission(
    IN operation VARCHAR(10),
    IN sid INT,
    IN branch VARCHAR(50),
    IN sname VARCHAR(50),
    IN maths INT,
    IN phy INT,
    IN chem INT,
    IN tot INT
)
BEGIN
    IF operation = 'INSERT' THEN
        INSERT INTO ADMIS (BRANCH, SID, SNAME, MATHS, PHY, CHEM, TOT)
        VALUES (branch, sid, sname, maths, phy, chem, tot);

    ELSEIF operation = 'DELETE' THEN
        DELETE FROM ADMIS WHERE SID = sid;

    ELSEIF operation = 'UPDATE' THEN
        UPDATE ADMIS
        SET BRANCH = branch, SNAME = sname, MATHS = maths, PHY = phy, CHEM = chem, TOT = tot
        WHERE SID = sid;

    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;


### Part (b): Trigger to Implement Admission Process

This trigger updates the SEATPOSITION table whenever a new record is inserted into the ADMIS table, to keep track of the number of admitted students and vacancies.

sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER AfterAdmissionInsert
AFTER INSERT ON ADMIS
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DECLARE department_name VARCHAR(50);

    SET department_name = NEW.BRANCH;

    UPDATE SEATPOSITION
    SET ADMITTED = ADMITTED + 1,
        VACANCY = TOTALSEATS - ADMITTED
    WHERE DNAME = department_name;
END //

DELIMITER ;


### Additional Requirements

1. *Close Admission after a Specific Date*

   To close admissions after 2023-12-14, you could add a condition in the stored procedure or as a separate trigger that checks the current date before allowing new admissions.

   sql
   DELIMITER //

   CREATE TRIGGER CloseAdmissionAfterDate
   BEFORE INSERT ON ADMIS
   FOR EACH ROW
   BEGIN
       IF CURDATE() > '2023-12-14' THEN
           SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' 
           SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Admissions are closed for this year';
       END IF;
   END //

   DELIMITER ;
   

2. *Updating Seat Information on Insert/Update/Delete*

   You can add additional triggers for UPDATE and DELETE operations to adjust the SEATPOSITION table accordingly, similar to the AfterAdmissionInsert trigger.
