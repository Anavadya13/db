Query (a): Find the employee name and their salaries who work in companies located in “New York”.
Objective: Retrieve the names and salaries of employees working in companies based in New York.

Algorithm
Join Employee, Works, and Company tables:

Use the company-name field to join Works and Company (to retrieve company details).
Filter by Company Location:

In the WHERE clause, specify city = 'New York' to include only companies based in New York.
Select Required Columns:

Select employee_name and salary from the Employee table.

WHERE c.city = 'New York';
Query (b): Find all employees who earn more than each employee in the ‘TWIN BIRDS’ company.
Objective: Retrieve the names of employees who earn a salary greater than all employees working at "TWIN BIRDS".
