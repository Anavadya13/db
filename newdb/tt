1. Table Creation
Create a staff table with the following constraints:

Fields: staff_name, staff_id, department, age.
staff_id is the primary key.
age should be greater than 25 and less than 75.
All fields should be NOT NULL.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE staff (
    staff_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    staff_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age > 25 AND age < 75) NOT NULL
);
2. Queries
a. Display all staff name and department who belong to EC or ME
sql
Copy code
SELECT staff_name, department
FROM staff
WHERE department IN ('EC', 'ME');
b. Display all staff names whose names match with "ab…dc"
Assuming "ab…dc" means names starting with "ab" and ending with "dc", with any characters in between.

sql
Copy code
SELECT staff_name
FROM staff
WHERE staff_name LIKE 'ab%dc';
c. List details of all staff in alphabetical order within a particular department
Assuming we prompt for the department during query execution:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM staff
WHERE department = 'Specific_Department' -- replace with desired department
ORDER BY staff_name ASC;
3. Trigger Creation
Create a trigger to handle specific insertion conditions:

Block insertion if:
Age is below 30 and department is HR.
Name starts with "Z" and department is IT.
Allow insertion if:
Department is Finance and age is between 35 and 50 (inclusive).
Allow insertion otherwise.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TRIGGER staff_insert_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON staff
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Condition 1: Block if age < 30 and department is 'HR'
    IF NEW.age < 30 AND NEW.department = 'HR' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insertion blocked: Age is below 30 and department is HR.';
    
    -- Condition 2: Block if name starts with 'Z' and department is 'IT'
    ELSIF NEW.staff_name LIKE 'Z%' AND NEW.department = 'IT' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insertion blocked: Name starts with Z and department is IT.';
    
    -- Condition 3: Allow if department is 'Finance' and age is between 35 and 50 (inclusive)
    ELSIF NEW.department = 'Finance' AND NEW.age BETWEEN 35 AND 50 THEN
        -- No action needed; insertion is allowed
    
    -- Condition 4: Default case, allow insertion
    ELSE
        -- No action needed; insertion is allowed
    END IF;
END;
This setup covers all the requirements specified in the document.

Here’s an algorithmic breakdown for each part of the SQL assignment, explaining the steps that lead to each SQL command.

1. Algorithm to Create the staff Table
Objective: Create a staff table with specific fields and constraints.

Algorithm:

Define a table named staff.
Add a column staff_id:
Set its type to INT.
Make it the primary key.
Add a column staff_name:
Set its type to VARCHAR with a length of 50.
Make it NOT NULL.
Add a column department:
Set its type to VARCHAR with a length of 50.
Make it NOT NULL.
Add a column age:
Set its type to INT.
Make it NOT NULL.
Add a check constraint that ensures age is greater than 25 and less than 75.
SQL Code:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE staff (
    staff_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    staff_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age > 25 AND age < 75) NOT NULL
);
2. Algorithms for Each Query
a. Display all staff name and department who belong to EC or ME
Objective: Select the staff_name and department of all staff in the EC or ME department.

Algorithm:

Select staff_name and department from the staff table.
Filter the results to only include rows where the department is EC or ME.
SQL Code:

sql
Copy code
SELECT staff_name, department
FROM staff
WHERE department IN ('EC', 'ME');
b. Display all staff names matching "ab…dc" pattern
Objective: Select staff_name values that start with "ab" and end with "dc", with any characters in between.

Algorithm:

Select staff_name from the staff table.
Filter names using a pattern that:
Starts with "ab".
Has any number of characters in between.
Ends with "dc".
SQL Code:

sql
Copy code
SELECT staff_name
FROM staff
WHERE staff_name LIKE 'ab%dc';
c. List details of all staff in alphabetical order within a particular department
Objective: List all staff details in alphabetical order, filtered by a specific department.

Algorithm:

Select all columns from the staff table.
Filter the results to only include rows where department matches a specified value.
Sort the results by staff_name in ascending order.
SQL Code:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM staff
WHERE department = 'Specific_Department' -- replace with desired department
ORDER BY staff_name ASC;
3. Algorithm to Create the Trigger for Conditional Insertion
Objective: Create a trigger that blocks or allows insertion based on certain conditions.

Algorithm:

Define a trigger staff_insert_trigger that activates before an insert operation on the staff table.
For each insertion:
Condition 1: Check if age is below 30 and department is "HR".
If true, raise an error and block the insertion.
Condition 2: Check if staff_name starts with "Z" and department is "IT".
If true, raise an error and block the insertion.
Condition 3: Check if department is "Finance" and age is between 35 and 50 (inclusive).
If true, allow the insertion without any action.
Condition 4: For all other cases, allow the insertion without any action.
SQL Code:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TRIGGER staff_insert_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON staff
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Condition 1: Block if age < 30 and department is 'HR'
    IF NEW.age < 30 AND NEW.department = 'HR' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insertion blocked: Age is below 30 and department is HR.';
    
    -- Condition 2: Block if name starts with 'Z' and department is 'IT'
    ELSIF NEW.staff_name LIKE 'Z%' AND NEW.department = 'IT' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insertion blocked: Name starts with Z and department is IT.';
    
    -- Condition 3: Allow if department is 'Finance' and age is between 35 and 50 (inclusive)
    ELSIF NEW.department = 'Finance' AND NEW.age BETWEEN 35 AND 50 THEN
        -- No action needed; insertion is allowed
    
    -- Condition 4: Default case, allow insertion
    ELSE
        -- No action needed; insertion is allowed
    END IF;
END;

Question 1: Create a staff Table with Specific Constraints
Objective: Create a staff table with fields staff_name, staff_id, department, and age, with specific constraints.

Algorithm:

Start defining a new table called staff.
Add a column called staff_id:
Set its data type as INT.
Designate it as the primary key (ensures each staff_id is unique).
Add a column called staff_name:
Set its data type as VARCHAR with a maximum length of 50.
Add a NOT NULL constraint to ensure this field is always populated.
Add a column called department:
Set its data type as VARCHAR with a maximum length of 50.
Add a NOT NULL constraint to ensure this field is always populated.
Add a column called age:
Set its data type as INT.
Add a NOT NULL constraint to ensure this field is always populated.
Add a CHECK constraint to ensure age is greater than 25 and less than 75.
Complete the table definition with all the specified constraints.
Question 2a: Display All Staff Names and Departments for Staff Belonging to EC or ME Departments
Objective: Retrieve the names and departments of all staff members in the EC or ME departments.

Algorithm:

Select the columns staff_name and department from the staff table.
Use a condition to filter the rows where department is either "EC" or "ME".
Use the IN clause to specify multiple department values.
Execute the query to retrieve the filtered data.
Question 2b: Display All Staff Names Matching the Pattern "ab…dc"
Objective: Retrieve names of staff members that match a specific pattern: starting with "ab" and ending with "dc" (with any number of characters in between).

Algorithm:

Select the staff_name column from the staff table.
Use a LIKE condition to specify the pattern:
The name should start with "ab" and end with "dc".
Use the % wildcard to represent any characters in between.
Execute the query to retrieve names matching the specified pattern.
Question 2c: List All Staff Details in Alphabetical Order Within a Particular Department
Objective: Retrieve all details of staff members, ordered alphabetically by their names within a specified department.

Algorithm:

Select all columns from the staff table.
Use a WHERE condition to filter the rows for a specified department.
Replace "Specific_Department" with the actual department name when executing.
Use an ORDER BY clause on staff_name to arrange the rows in alphabetical order.
Execute the query to retrieve the ordered data for the specified department.
Question 3: Create a Trigger to Handle Conditional Insertions
Objective: Implement a trigger that blocks or allows insertion based on specific conditions.

Algorithm:

Define a BEFORE INSERT trigger on the staff table, which will activate before each insertion.
In the trigger definition, add conditional checks to determine whether to allow or block an insertion:
Condition 1: If age is below 30 and department is "HR":
Block the insertion by raising an error message stating "Insertion blocked: Age is below 30 and department is HR."
Condition 2: If staff_name starts with "Z" and department is "IT":
Block the insertion by raising an error message stating "Insertion blocked: Name starts with Z and department is IT."
Condition 3: If department is "Finance" and age is between 35 and 50 (inclusive):
Allow the insertion without taking any action.
Condition 4: In all other cases:
Allow the insertion without taking any action.
Define the SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' command in blocked cases to raise an error and halt the insertion.
Execute the trigger creation command.
